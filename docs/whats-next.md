# Afterwards: Post-Submission Process
### Once the archive package has been submitted, the following steps are handled by different teams. This page outlines what to expect.

---

## NCEI Responsibilities
- **Review the package:** NCEI will conduct their own review and will notify your team if any edits are required.
- **Assign an accession number:** While ingesting the data into their database, they will assign it a formal accession number.

## Data Services Team (DST) Responsibilities

- **Update linkages:** The DST will go in and update linkages in ‘Distribution Info’  to the new accession.
- **Provide metadata files:** The DST provides NCEI with the InPort metadata `.xml` files.
- **Make the record public:** The DST will make the InPort page public & update dataset start date in ‘Distribution’ or Publish date if necessary.

## Your Final Responsibilities

- **Update tracking documents:** Update any of your own tracking spreadsheets or documents with the new submission details and accession number.
- **Update dataset details for the future:** Add any notes or information to the Dataset Details document that could be helpful for the next data archivist or for the next time this dataset is published.
