# Data Package Review and Submission
### This is the final quality control step before submitting the archive package. A thorough review ensures accuracy and a smooth submission process.

---

## Get a Peer Review

The most important step is to get a "second set of eyes" to review the entire archive package. This helps catch any errors or omissions that might have been missed.

The review should cover all components together:
- [ ] The Dataset
- [ ] The Data Dictionary
- [ ] The InPort Record
- [ ] The S2N Package


## Final Checks and Notes

Before uploading your files, there are a couple of final details to consider.

- [ ] **Add contextual notes:** In the 'Notes' section of the S2N submission form, mention if this is an NCRMP dataset or if it is related to any other submissions. 
> You can also add any other important caveats here.

- [ ] **Check the dataset size:** The S2N system has a **100GB limit**. If your dataset is larger than this, you must provide a **Google Drive link** in the 'Notes' section instead of uploading the file directly.

## Submit the Package
> **Note:** Most likely a Data Manager will do this step.


You have two options for uploading your files.

1.  **If you have many files:** It's best to zip the dataset and data dictionary together into a single `.zip` file and upload that.
2.  **If you only have a few files:** You can upload the `.csv` files directly.

Once your files are uploaded and your notes are complete, click the **'Submit'** button.
